Thank You for your interest in the CAN2Cluster project. It's great to see you looking over

to share your work with the "cluster" community.

The CAN2Cluster project Forum is an ideal place to do that. It's also the place to ask 
technical questions.  

So take two minutes and join the rc-cam forum. Then create a CAN2Cluster topic and provide
