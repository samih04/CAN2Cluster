# Can2Cluster
Welcome to the Can2Cluster project. It is a Can-Bus emulator for Controlling Automotive Dashboard Instrument Clusters. Under development is a version for a 2005-2010 Ford Mustang instrument cluster. Expansion to other Can Bus controlled dashboards should be possible by modifying the Arduino firmware.

### The Can2Cluster Team

### Project Status
* Dec-27-2018: Ordered Can-Bus hardware (Mega2560 R3 & CanBus Shield). Should arrive late January 2019.
* Dec-28-2018: Purchased 2009 Ford Mustang Instrument Cluster from online auto wrecker parts store.

### Notes & Comments
The goal of the project is to create a standalone (no PC) benchtop CanBus emulator that controls the instrument cluster's gauges and warning lights. It is a minimal no-frills design that can be expanded by project builders to suit their application.

Possible expamples: 
- Functional Dashboard for Auto Race Games.
- Custom Car Dashboard Conversion.
- Automobile / Motorcycle Instrument Cluster Tester.
