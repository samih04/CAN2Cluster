# CAN2Cluster 
Welcome to the CAN2Cluster project. It is a Arduino based CAN-Bus system for controlling Automotive Dashboard Instrument Clusters. Under development is a version that directly interfaces with a 2005-2009 Ford Mustang (six gauge) instrument cluster. Expansion to other CAN-Bus controlled dashboards should be possible by end-user development of the Arduino firmware.

### Hardware Summary
* Arduino MEGA2560 R3.
* MCP2515/TJA1050 CAN-Bus Modules (2 pcs, for HS & MS CAN-Bus Ports).

### Project Status Timeline
* Dec-27-2018: Ordered CAN-Bus hardware.
* Dec-28-2018: Purchased Ford Mustang Instrument Cluster from online auto wrecker parts supplier.
* Jan-04-2019: Received Microchip CAN-Bus Analyzer Tool.
* Jan-08-2019: Received Instrument Cluster. CAN-Bus control working with Analyzer Tool.
* Jan-21-2019: CAN-Bus Test Software Video Demo now available. See Video Demo section below.
* Feb-01-2019: Gauge animation functions completed. 

### Notes & Comments
The goal of the project is to create a CAN-Bus controlled instrument cluster for entertaining desktop demonstrations. Based on popular Arduino hardware, it will animate the instrument cluster's gauges and warning lights. Besides pre-defined animations, there will be serial host access that will allow the user to manually control the gauges and indicators.

The code could be adapted for a variety of applications, For example:
- Automobile Instrument Cluster Tester.
- Animated dashboard display for education, art, or entertainment.
- Dashboard for Race Gaming Cockpit.
- Custom Car Dashboard Conversions.
