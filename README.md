# Can2Cluster
Welcome to the Can2Cluster project. It is a Can-Bus emulator for Controlling Automotive Dashboard Instrument Clusters. Under development is a version for a 2005-2010 Ford Mustang instrument cluster. Expansion to other Can Bus controlled clusters should be possible by modifying the Arduino firmware.
