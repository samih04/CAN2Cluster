# CAN2Cluster 
Welcome to the CAN2Cluster project. It is a CAN-Bus emulator for Controlling Automotive Dashboard Instrument Clusters. Under development is a version for a 2005-2009 Ford Mustang instrument panel. Expansion to other CAN-Bus controlled dashboards should be possible by end-user development of the Arduino firmware.

### The Can2Cluster Team
* Thomas B. (@thomastech, Project Originator)
* YOUR Name Here.

### Hardware Summary
* Arduino MEGA2560 R3.
* MCP2515 CAN-Bus Controller Shield (for HS CAN-Bus).
* MCP2515/TJA1050 CAN-Bus Module (for MS CAN-Bus).

### Project Status
* Dec-27-2018: Ordered CAN-Bus hardware. Should arrive by February 2019.
* Dec-28-2018: Purchased Ford Mustang Instrument Cluster from online auto wrecker parts supplier.
* Jan-04-2019: Received CAN-Bus Analyzer tool.

### Notes & Comments
The goal of the project is to create a standalone benchtop Can-Bus emulator that controls the instrument cluster's gauges and warning lights. It is a minimal no-frills design that can be expanded by project builders to suit their application.

Some Application Examples: 
- Functional Dashboard for Race Gaming Cockpit.
- Custom Car Dashboard Conversions.
- Automobile / Motorbike Instrument Cluster Tester.
