# Are You a Fan of the CAN2Cluster Project?
Thanks for visiting the CAN2Cluster project. It was created by a guy named Thomas who enjoys making electronic gadgets. 
Sometimes for his own amusement and other times to entertain family and friends. 
His gadgets won't change the world but maybe they'll bring a few smiles.

If you like this project and would like to buy Thomas a cup of coffee as appreciation for his efforts, then please click the donate link below.
